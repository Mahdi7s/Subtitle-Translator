I developed a clean-coded subtitle translator with Winamp and KMPlayer plugin implemented by WPF and C# about 13 years ago.

### Features:
- One-Click word translation
- Adding different language glossaries
- Ability to work with different Video Players such as KMPlayer and Winamp
- Supporting popular subtitle formats
- Save states in the Database
